# Project Name: Facial Recognition Final Project

Desc: My project uses code to detect and name faces in an image that I provided.

## The Algorithm

I used python to code this project, and then I got images to create my dataset for this facial recognition project. For this, I used to very helpful libraries: openCV and face_recognition, and these two libraries already have pre-trained models. Using openCV, I can create rectangles that will outline and create a border around a person's face. In my project, I used three tennis stars: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. I would need the have pictures of all three of them and encode them with the facial recognition library. I also need to have a group photo of your faces, that way it can detect faces more efficiently (this group phot will also be a test image). Using a for loop, we can create rectangles to detect the faces and just facial recognition. Even though I tried using FaceNet, I can just run a simple command, so there won't be any relevant code to it.

## Running this project

First step is to install and remove openCV, as that is a major library in this code. Another library that is required to install is face_recognition, which has a few pre-trained models. Because this is face recognition, you need a dataset of faces. I used three top tennis stars: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. Create a folder with all the images of the people needed. One thing before coding is to learn the different functions and uses of openCV and face_recognition. I've learned these libraries in school and in other classes before. After coding and getting the datasets, it is time to train the models. After training, you can either run a command on ssh or scp, or just run the project in the linux terminal. However, since I couldn't do headless, I used the monitor and ran it in linux. To make it simpler, another way to run it is using python3 after training.
